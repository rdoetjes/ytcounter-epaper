# YouTube Statistics on ePaper module

## Extremely long battery life
I wanted a piece of hardware that could run many months/years without recharging and show my YouTube statistics.<br />
This solution will work >=200.000 hours between charges! Thanks to using the ESP32 deep sleep functionality (which draws ~10uA) and the ePaper that continues to show information when the microcontroller is in deep sleep or even, when powered off completely!
